            <p class="text-body-p">For any individual who has what Vocational Rehabilitation calls barriers to employment some of the services we offer in partnership with Vocational Rehabilitation are Vocational Exploration, Assessment, Job Development, and Job Coaching. Additionally we work with employers to seek work incentives (which encourage the employer to hire a person who has a disability) such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, On the Job Training, Internships and equipment/technology that the employer would not normally need to conduct their business. </p>

                    <h2 class="second-heading"> Job Development</h2>

                    <p class="text-body-p as-p">Our job development program is an exciting part of our work and the heart of what we strive to achieve for each job seeker. The job seekers we work with have various challenges in their lives. Job development is designed to help each job seeker achieve their full potential to work and achieve their unique goals. The Job Developer/Employment Specialist identifies job opportunities in the workplace which are unique to the job seeker being mindful of the job seekers skills and interests to ensure a successful match to the job seeker and employer’s needs. Job Development may include support with the application and interview process, as well as visits with potential employers. The end goal is to assist the job seeker to become more successful, productive and independent. Additionally, our aim is to assist job seekers in finding sustainable employment so that each job seeker is eager to go to work each day because the job match works for them.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-p as-p">Our mission is carried out through a variety of programs and services, all with one goal — to help people with disadvantages become more successful, productive, and independent.</p>

                    <h2 class="second-heading">Job Coaching</h2>

                    <p class="text-body-p por-p">Job Coaching is available to help clients learn new tasks and support their transition into a new job. Job Coaches can assist in teaching new skills if the client is moved to a new position or is seeking promotion. They can help the client build relationships with their coworkers, learn about the rules of the business, and support them in being successful at work. Additionally, we focus on job retention, making sure the client is comfortable with the position and confident in his or her abilities. Example: Stephanie works hard and got a job at a local video shop! Her job coach, Julie, helps her learn the tasks she has in her new job. Julie works with Stephanie to make sure she knows how to do her job. She also supports Stephanie in learning how to tell her supervisor or co-workers when she needs help or additional direction, and to know her routine and schedule.</p>
