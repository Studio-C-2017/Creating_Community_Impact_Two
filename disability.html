            <h2 class="second-heading">What is Discovery?</h2>
            <p class="text-body-p">If the client needs more information in order to help find out what he or she wants to do for work, they may be referred to a service called Discovery. The purpose is to learn about their unique skills and talents or in other words, “Your personal genius”.  Creating Community Impact uses a Person Centered approach spending one to one time with the client at their home and in the community. We help identify the client’s likes/dislikes. To assist learning we may visit the client at their home, tour several different community settings, and may include arranging volunteer or work experience opportunities in order to search for the type of jobs that best match the client’s interests and strengths. Example: Darren and his team are having a difficult time trying to find the best work fit for him. He definitely wants a job, his independence, and to meet new people, but Darren doesn’t know what to do. Gwyn meets with Darren, his team, and takes him to different places in the community to see what skills he may already have. Gwyn notices he is great at smiling, greeting and remembering names of people he meets throughout the day. Darren is also very detailed when he completes a task and always offers to help others when they are struggling. Gwyn notes these strengths, as well as others that he has seen, into a Discovery profile. Once Gwyn feels she has a good idea of what Darren will be happiest doing in the community, she completes the Discovery profile. The Discovery Profile leads to other services such as Path to Employment or Job Development.</p>

            <h2 class="second-heading">What is Employment Path?</h2>
            <p class="text-body-p">Employment Path Services are services to provide learning and work experiences. It may including volunteer opportunities. The goal of Employment Path Services is for an individual to develop general employment skills that may be used in an integrated community job. These are time limited services as outlined in the client’s Individual Service Plan (ISP), which means they can only be used until the goal has been met. Specific goals will be written into the ISP and will be reached through an ongoing person-centered planning process. Example: Janice wants a community job where she gets to meet a lot of new people, but needs to work on some skills – like handling cash and customer service. Her Service Coordinator/Personal Agent connects her with Gwyn, an Employment Path Specialist. Gwyn helps Janice get a chance to volunteer at a local bookstore and other small businesses. She also worked with Gwyn on answering phone calls and responding to questions. After a few months of practicing, Janice is doing great and she is confident to take the next step of looking for her individual job!</p>


            <h2 class="second-heading">What is Long Term Job Support?</h2>
            <p class="text-body-p"> Creating Community Impact provides job coaching support to individuals who are in community jobs. Creating community Impact job coaches are there to support the client and assist them in becoming as independent as possible at their job. We work to set-up natural supports at work so that co-workers are there to assist the client as we fade from one to one supports when the client is ready. Ongoing supports are customized to client needs to ensure that they are successful in their employment and meet the standards expected of their employer.</p>
